# Common Questions
## Tell us about your current position
Right now I work at Samsung as backend tech lead. Our project is connected with the ***SmartThings*** smart home application. The problem we are trying to solve is connected with the process of certifying partners' devices. Right now it looks like this:
- Partner wants to integrate their device with the ***SmartThings***  platform and slap a sticker ***Works With SmartThings*** on the box
- They try to integrate and after that request Samsung to certify the device
- They send the device to the certification team, which in turn tests the device manually
- If there is something wrong with the device, process slows down significantly due to the nature of b2b communications

Our application is going to automate a part of the certification process. Core functionalities are:
1) Generating the device test plan based on the device's capabilities
2) Executing it against the device

Around the core functionality we have a bunch of services for user journey.

# Why do you want to leave
## Learning
The main thing that I am looking for in a job is opportunities to learn something new. That's what I generally like about software engineering itself. Just to stay afloat you have to constantly learn and evolve, which are the things I enjoy doing. 

Now, my current project is interesting and all, but after we have released, the active development has basically ended and the pace of development has dropped, so there are less interesting and challenging tasks and it is basically have been a smooth ride from that point.

Because of that I tried to find some challenges outside of my project. One of those challenges was Internal Software Certification.

## Motivation System
Another thing I unfortunately lack at my current company is a good motivational system.

The system of promotions and bonuses has been propagated from Korea and, while it works really well there, doesn't fit well the European market. It very rigid and restrictive.

In a nutshell it looks like this:
- you are given a set of goals with different weights in the beginning of the year
- in the end of the year you score yourself in every goal and specify why you have gave yourself that score
- after that your manager overwrites you scores with his scores
- after that his manager does the same
Another important note is that there is limited amount of good marks that the team can have, and the manager himself it in the team pool, so he gives the mark himself
