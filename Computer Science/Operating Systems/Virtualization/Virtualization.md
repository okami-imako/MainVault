The primary way the [[Operating System]] makes sure the system operates *correctly* and *efficiently* in an *easy-to-use manner* is through a general technique that is called ***virtualization***.

That is, the OS takes a *physical* resource (such as the processor, or memory, or a disk) and transforms it into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use ***virtual*** form of itself. Thus, we sometimes refer to the operating system as a ***virtual machine***.
